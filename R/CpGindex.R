#' Measure hypermethylation-at-PRCs-in-CGIs and hypomethylation-at-WCGWs-in-PMDs
#'
#' At some point in some conference call somewhere, a collaborator suggested
#' that a simple index of Polycomb repressor complex (PRC) binding site hyper-
#' methylation and CpG-poor "partially methylated domain" (PMD) hypomethylation
#' would be a handy yardstick for both deterministic and stochastic changes 
#' associated with proliferation, aging, and cancer. This function provides 
#' such an index by compiling measures of aberrant hyper- and hypo-methylation
#' along with the ratio of hyper- to hypo-methylation. (The logic for this is 
#' that while the phenomena tend to occur together, there are many exceptions)
#' The resulting measures can provide a high-level summary of proliferation-,
#' aging-, and/or disease-associated changes in DNA methylation across samples.
#' 
#' The choice of defaults is fairly straightforward: in 2006, three independent 
#' groups reported recurrent hypermethylation in cancer at sites marked by both
#' H3K4me3 (activating) and H3K27me3 (repressive) histone marks in embryonic
#' stem cells; these became known as "bivalent" sites. The Roadmap Epigenome 
#' project performed ChIP-seq on hundreds of normal primary tissues and cell 
#' line results from the ENCODE project to generate a systematic catalog of 
#' "chromatin states" alongside dozens of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing 
#' experiments in the same tissues. We used both to generate a default atlas 
#' of bivalent (Polycomb-associated and transcriptionally-poised) sites from 
#' H9 human embryonic stem cells which retain low DNA methylation across normal
#' (non-placental) REMC tissues. In 2018, Zhou and Dinh (Nature Genetics) found
#' isolated [AT]CG[AT] sites, or "solo-WCGW" motifs, in common PMDs as the most
#' universal barometer of proliferation- and aging-associated methylation loss 
#' in mammalian cells, so we use their solo-WCGW sites in common PMDs as the 
#' default measure for hypomethylation. The resulting CpGindex is a vector of
#' length 3 for each sample: hypermethylation, hypomethylation, and their ratio.
#'
#' We suggest fitting a model for the composition of bulk samples (tumor/normal,
#' tissue1/tissue2, or whatever is most appropriate) prior to drawing any firm 
#' conclusions from the results of this function. For example, a mixture of 
#' two-thirds normal tissue and one-third tumor tissue may produce the same or 
#' lower degree of hyper/hypomethylation than high-tumor-content cell-free DNA 
#' samples from the blood plasma of the same patient. Intuition is simply not 
#' a reliable guide in such situations, which occur with some regularity. If 
#' orthogonal estimates of purity/composition are available (flow cytometry, 
#' ploidy, yield of filtered cfDNA), it is a Very Good Idea to include them. 
#' 
#' The default for this function is to use the HMM-defined CpG islands from 
#' Hao Wu's paper (Wu, Caffo, Jaffee, Irizarry & Feinberg, Biostatistics 2010) 
#' as generic "hypermethylation" targets inside of "bivalent" (H3K27me3+H3K4me3)
#' sites (identified in H9 embryonic stem cells & unmethylated across normals),
#' and the solo-WCGW sites within common partially methylated domains from 
#' Wanding Zhou and Huy Dinh's paper (Zhou, Dinh, et al, Nat Genetics 2018)
#' as genetic "hypomethylation" targets (as above, obvious caveats about tissue
#' specificity and user-supplied possibilities exist, but the defaults are sane
#' for many purposes, and can be exchanged for whatever targets a user wishes). 
#' 
#' The function returns all three components of the "CpG index", comprised of 
#' hyperCGI and hypoPMD (i.e. hyper, hypo, and their ratio). The PMD "score" is 
#' a base-coverage-weighted average of losses to solo-WCGW bases within PMDs;
#' the PRC score is similarly base-coverage-weighted but across HMM CGI CpGs,
#' within polycomb repressor complex sites (by default, the subset of state 23
#' segments in the 25-state, 12-mark ChromImpute model for H9 which have less 
#' than 10 percent CpG methylation across the CpG-island-overlapping segment in
#' all normal primary tissues and cells from the Reference Epigenome project). 
#' By providing different targets and/or regions, users can customize as needed.
#'
#' The return value is a CpGindex object, which is really just a DataFrame that 
#' knows about the regions at which it was summarized, and reminds the user of 
#' this when they implicitly call the `show` method on it.
